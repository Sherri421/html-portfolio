<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Sherri and I am learning to be a web developer. I have been learning and studying hard the last few months. 
</p>
<p>
  I work as an Online English Teacher during the morning, look after my two beautiful kids during the afternoon and study at night. Its really a full day for me but I try my 
  best to make it work.
</p>
<p>
I would like to change my career because I think I have exhausted the avenue of teaching and now looking forward to exploring where HTML, CSS, JavaScript and all that can take me.
